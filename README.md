# CNY 2015 Animation

This is basically an animation based off Chinese brush strokes. And these Chinese brush strokes are rendered via CSS, using rounded divs and the shadow property. Setting *x* and *y* properties at odd angles will give you a variety of shapes that resemble Chinese brush strokes, and with a bit of rotation, they can work wonders.
